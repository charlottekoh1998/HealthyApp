# Project Title

Healthy living for health-conscious peeps

## Summary

By recommending interesting menu ranging from simple to complex, and home exercises ranging from easy to advanced, we can cater to the needs of each individual who wants to adopt a healthier lifestyle in this pandemic world today. It aims to help users meet their goals of having a balanced diet, where nutrition and physical activity play a big role. 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

For the past 1-2 years since the pandemic started, many have stayed home and took a step back from their hectic working lives due to the strict quarantine orders. By staying and working from home most of the time, most of us turn to cooking and exercising to make time pass faster and escape from the stay-home boredom. With a new routine, we become more aware of our personal health and hence start to adopt a healthier lifestyle.Since we all depended on eating out or going to the gym during pre-pandemic times, we might not be very good at cooking or home exercises. Therfore, this project aims to recommend recipes and exercises personalized for each individual depending on the goal that they wish to achieve (eg. weight loss, muscle building). This eases the life of users who have no idea where to start, especially for beginners, or for people who have run out of menus or are tired of their routine exercises. 


## How is it used?
Menu:
Give recommendations on healthy recipes (asian, western cuisines) based on homecooks' or chefs' experiences, while users get to choose if they want to use certain ingredients.
Able to allow users to customize their recipes at the same time given the ingredients they have at home, or their allergies.
App will recommend substitutes for certain ingredients in the recipe that the user does not have (eg. yogurt for applesauce)
Nutrition calculator to count the calories and nutrition facts for the whole recipe

Exercise:
Based on what the user searches in the search bar, can recommend similar exercises for them (eg slim leg exercises, abs exercise).
Allow users to enter their body shape and goal (to lose weight or build muscle or gain weight etc) and the app will recommend the type of exercises for them (yoga, pilates, cardio, etc) on a weekly/monthly plan and the duration of each workout (to user's preference)
Estimate the calories expenditure for the workout each day according to user's weight and heart beat
Link to phone's health app (eg apple health) to track their steps, heartbeat, etc 

## Challenges
Some apps have already done this but is not free. However, it might be difficult to get free recipes and exercises unless we have experts for that. However, a diverse range of food or exercise from different people all around the world is more interesting than having a small group of our own people planning the menu and workout plan. 

## What next?
We might need to source for sponsors (especially influencers) so that we can widen the range of our app to more people, and get diverse range of recipes and workout plans to attract people to use our app. 


## Acknowledgments
I personally want such app.
